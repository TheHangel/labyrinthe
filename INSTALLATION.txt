# Installation Instructions for Labyrinthe

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
  - **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) or compatible C compiler
  - **Make** (build automation tool)
  - **ncurses library** (for terminal graphics, needed to display the game)

On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install `ncurses` using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

On macOS, ncurses is usually pre-installed. If not, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ncurses
```

# Troubleshooting

**ncurses Errors**: If the game fails to compile due to missing ncurses libraries, ensure libncurses5-dev or libncursesw5-dev is installed (see prerequisites).
**Undefined SEED**: If using a specific seed, run with:

```bash
make SEED=<integer_value>
```
